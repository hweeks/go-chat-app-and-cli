# go chatt app and cli

## overview

i'm learning go, so i thought i'd do it the fun way and build some actual app, trying to make it 'production worthy'. to that end i'm going to layout my plan here so that i can forget it!

## plan

core features:

* frontend to chat
* backend in go
* data in mysql
* user login
* room CRUD
* message CRUD
* cli app to chat

## progress

* frontend skeleton done
* dev mode functional

## how to

this is a hybrid project in a monorepo. using yarn 3 we are adding a series of util from the npm ecosystem to lubricate and improve the go dev experience.

### getting started

to init:

```
$ yarn
```

to dev:

```
$ yarn dev
```

*MUST HAVE DOCKER, NODE, YARN installed*
