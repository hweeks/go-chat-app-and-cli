# roadmap

## overview of application

this app will feature these core features:

[ ] a react frontend
[ ] a cli frontend
[ ] a go backend
[ ] use mysql
[ ] use websocket
[ ] have tests (go and ts)
[ ] deploy site and backend

this app will do these things:

[ ] allow user, room, and message creation
[ ] allow a user to send a message to a room
[ ] have all clients in that room get the message over a websocket
[ ] make the CLI and UI have feature parity (at a core level)
[ ] rooms monitor who is logged in and out

this app serves to:

[ ] teach me go, with a real world example
[ ] teach others all of these things from the ground up truly
[ ] let me explore my passions without profit!
